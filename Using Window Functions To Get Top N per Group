Description
Given the schema presented below write a query, which uses a window function, that returns two most viewed posts for every category.

Order the result set by:

category name alphabetically
number of post views largest to lowest
post id lowest to largest
Note:
Some categories may have less than two or no posts at all.
Two or more posts within the category can be tied by (have the same) the number of views. Use post id as a tie breaker - a post with a lower id gets a higher rank.

/*

select 
  category_id, category, title, views, post_id 
from 
  (select c.id as "category_id", c.category, p.title,p.views,p.id as post_id,
  rank() over (partition by c.id 
                order by c.category desc, p.views desc, p.id asc)
  from 
      categories c 
  left join 
      posts p on c.id = p.category_id) as rank_filter 
where 
  rank <= 2
order by 
  category asc, views desc, post_id asc;
