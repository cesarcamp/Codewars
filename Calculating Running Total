Description
Given a posts table that contains a created_at timestamp column write a query that returns date (without time component), a number of posts for a given date and a running (cumulative) total number of posts up until a given date. The resulting set should be ordered chronologically by date.

Desired Output
The resulting set should look similar to the following:

date       | count | total
-----------+-------+-------
2017-01-26 |    20 |    20
2017-01-27 |    17 |    37
2017-01-28 |     7 |    44
2017-01-29 |     8 |    52
...

/* SOLUTION */

with data as (

  select date(created_at) as date, count(title) as count, (select count(title)) as total 
  from posts
  group by date
  order by date asc
)

select date, count, cast(sum(total) over (order by date) as integer) as total
from data
