Description
Given a posts table that contains a created_at timestamp column write a query that returns date (without time component), a number of posts for a given date and a running (cumulative) total number of posts up until a given date. The resulting set should be ordered chronologically by date.

Desired Output
The resulting set should look similar to the following:

date       | count | total
-----------+-------+-------
2017-01-26 |    20 |    20
2017-01-27 |    17 |    37
2017-01-28 |     7 |    44
2017-01-29 |     8 |    52
...

/* SOLUTION */

WTH data as (

  SELECT date(created_at) as date, COUNT(title) AS count, (SELECT COUNT(title)) AS total 
  FROM posts
  GROUP BY date
  ORDER BY date asc
)

SELECT date, count, CAST(SUM(total) OVER (ORDER BY date) AS integer) AS total
FROM data
